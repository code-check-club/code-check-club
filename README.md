# Code Check Club

Notes on how to organise a code check club.

The first step is to identify some possible code to be checked. Ideally for the first few, this will be:

- in a language most of the members know
- straightforward analyses
- not too long
- the coder or a person very familiar with the code will attend

See <https://code-check-club.github.io/code-check-club/> for further info.
